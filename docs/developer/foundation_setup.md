# Foundation Setup

## Overview

POTOS integrates with Ethereum-based applications for seamless interoperability. If you are coming from Ethereum, you'll find the transition smooth and easy.

For more details on POTOS's architecture, please refer to [What is POTOS?](../concepts/potos.md).

## POTOS Network

POTOS has two networks: Testnet and Mainnet.

- Testnet is for testing and development purposes.
- Mainnet is for production purposes.

| Network Information | POTOS Mainnet          | POTOS Testnet                  |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Network name        | POTOS Mainnet          | POTOS Testnet                  |
| Default RPC URL     | https://rpc.potos.hk/  | https://rpc-testnet.potos.hk/  |
| Chain ID            | 60603                  | 60600                          |
| Currency symbol     | POT                    | POT                            |
| Block explorer URL  | https://scan.potos.hk/ | https://scan-testnet.potos.hk/ |

You can find the details of the networks in [JSON RPC Endpoints](../references/rpc_endpoints.md).
