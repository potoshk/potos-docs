# Glossary

This chapter provides a comprehensive advanced consensus of the POTOS blockchain ecosystem.

We'll start with the fundamentals of POTOS accounts, including their data structure, types, key pairs, and creation processes for both externally-owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts.

Next, we'll dive into POTOS transactions, outlining their prerequisites, data structure, and lifecycle.

Additionally, it explores transaction fees, including gas prices, gas usage, gas limits, and POTOS-specific gas configurations.

The roles and operation of nodes within the network are discussed, along with consensus algorithms like PBFT and PoS-rPBFT.
