# Basics

This chapter introduce a punch of basic concepts of decentralized tech.

We'll start with the basics of blockchain, exploring its types, how it operates, and the role of smart contracts.

Then, we'll define Web3, its features, and compare it to Web 2.0, noting its benefits and limitations.

Next, we'll define DApps, comparing them to traditional apps.

Finally, we'll cover crypto walletsâ€”what they are, how they work, and the differences between traditional, custodial, and non-custodial wallets.
