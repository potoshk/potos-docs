# Intro to DApps

Decentralized application, or DApp, is an application designed to operate on a decentralized network, combining smart contracts and a user interface. Dapps are part of the broader movement towards decentralized systems, aiming to reduce the control wielded by centralized authorities and increase user autonomy.

FISCO BCOS fully supports Dapp integration, enabling developers to harness the power of financial-grade decentralized networks.

## Definition of a DApp

Dapps have several defining characteristics:

- **Decentralization:** Backend code runs on a peer-to-peer network, not on centralized servers.
- **Determinism:** They perform the same function regardless of the environment in which they are executed.
- **Turing Completeness:** They can perform any computation given sufficient resources.
- **Isolation:** Executed in a virtual environment (like the Ethereum Virtual Machine), ensuring that bugs in a smart contract do not affect the broader network.

## Comparison with Traditional Apps

| Feature             | Dapp                           | Traditional App                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure**  | Decentralized network          | Centralized servers            |
| **Control**         | Distributed among users        | Controlled by a single entity  |
| **Data Management** | Immutable and transparent      | Mutable and potentially opaque |
| **Trust**           | Trustless, via smart contracts | Requires trust in the provider |
| **Scalability**     | Limited by network capacity    | Scales with server capacity    |
| **User Experience** | Can be complex                 | Generally more straightforward |
